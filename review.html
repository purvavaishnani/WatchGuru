                        <div>IWC’s Timezoner was developed to be an ideal travel companion. A quick spin of the bezel suffices to show a new time zone, and a built-in flyback chronograph makes this an exceptional timepiece at a reasonable price. We give it a closer look in this feature from the WatchTime archives, with original photography by Olaf Köster.

                            Flying through time zones with the IWC Pilot’s Watch Timezoner Chronograph is a reliable undertaking, not only because IWC’s expertise with pilots’ watches dates back to 1936. Once the time change has been programmed, it always works perfectly.<br><br>
                            The programming sequence relies on an unusual arrangement between the case and the movement. To correctly set this world-time watch, you begin by pressing the rotatable bezel downward against the stainless-steel case, which is nearly 46 mm in diameter. Then you turn the depressed bezel until the reference location for your home time zone appears at 12 o’clock, directly above the little triangle on the flange. If daylight savings time is currently in effect, you must rotate the bezel one position farther until the city’s accompanying dot with the letter “S” (as in “summer”) is in the 12 o’clock position. When positioning the bezel, you must press the rotating ring down firmly at two opposite points and make sure that it clicks securely into the desired setting. This isn’t hard because the ring snaps into place with a click that you can both hear and feel. The click indicates that the adjusting process is complete. Now the rotatable ring can’t be repositioned by mistake.

                        We compared three elegant chronographs from Frederique Constant, Stowa, and Staudt. Visually, they all benefit from a symmetrical dial layout and lack of a date window, but are they more than just pretty faces? Find out in this review from our archives, with original photos by Olaf Köster.

                    <div>
                        Elegant chronographs belong to a very special category of watches that combine sportiness with a noble demeanor. Think of them as Riva speedboats for mere mortals. Chronographs are particularly handsome when their counters are positioned at 3 and 9, in a symmetrical arrangement called “bicompax.” If the chronographs also make do without a date display, as is the case with our three test watches, then they offer the best prerequisites for creating pure and convincing styling.<br><br>
                        <b>Frederique Constant: Classic Design</b><br><br>
                        Frederique Constant takes the sportiest route of the three watches we tested with its Vintage Rally Healey Chronograph. This is an automotive-inspired watch with a perforated-leather racing strap made in collaboration with former sports car manufacturer Austin-Healey. The large numerals at 12 and 6 as well as the applied and luminous indexes create a dynamic effect. This is the only one of our trio of test watches that shows the time in the dark. And that is by no means the only interesting detail of this model’s dial. Bordeaux red distinguishes the minutes ring, the elapsed-seconds hand and the two small hands for the elapsed minutes, and the continually running seconds.

                        <div>Oris and Sinn have released smaller versions of their popular dive watches, the Aquis Date and U50. What can these 41- and 41.5-mm-diameter newcomers do? Find out in this comparative review from our October 2020 issue, with original photos by Nik Schölzel.
                        </div><br>
                        <div>
                            “Honey, I shrunk the U1” is the headline of Sinn’s ad for its new U50. And Oris is making a scaled-down version of its Aquis Date. Fortunately, however, these watches haven’t become quite as tiny as the children in the 1989 movie, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. And their larger role models (the 44-mm Sinn U1 and the 43.5-mm Aquis Date) remain in the brands’ portfolios.<br><br>
                            The victory march of gigantic watches is over; today’s trend is toward moderately sized timepieces. Sinn and Oris emphasize this with the 41-mm U50 and the 41.5-mm Aquis Date, our test watches. They have responded to their customers’ requests for a more moderately sized divers’ watch. The smaller dimensions of the models presented in 2020 have tangible advantages. These watches are more comfortable to wear, they aren’t so top-heavy, and they’re less likely to get caught on nearby objects, especially the U50, which is only 11.15 mm high.<br><br>
                            These two moderately sized dive watches are visually very different from each other. Sinn bead-blasts the case and strap, relocates the crown away from the back of the hand to the 4 o’clock position, trims the dial with instrumental styling and optimizes legibility thanks to strong contrast between applied luminous material and a matte black background.
